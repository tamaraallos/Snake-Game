# Snake Game

Welcome to the Old School Snake Game! This project is a classic implementation of the popular snake game, where players control a snake that grows by consuming food. The game provides an enjoyable and nostalgic gaming experience, capturing the essence of the beloved retro arcade games.


## What the Project Does
The Old School Snake Game allows players to control a snake using keyboard inputs to navigate around the game board. The objective is to eat the food that appears on the board and grow longer with each successful consumption. However, the game comes with a challenge: players must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. Collisions result in a reset of the game, including the score.

To enhance the gaming experience, this project introduces a feature to save the highest score achieved by the player. The highest score is stored in a file, enabling future references and friendly competition among players.

## Why the Project is Useful
The Old School Snake Game serves as a fun and entertaining pastime, invoking a sense of nostalgia for those familiar with classic arcade games. It provides an opportunity to relive the joy of playing the simple yet addictive snake game, popularized during the early days of gaming.

Additionally, this project can be a valuable resource for individuals learning programming or game development. By examining the source code and structure of the game, learners can gain insights into concepts such as game loops, collision detection, input handling, and score tracking.
